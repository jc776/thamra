## Done
- get started!
- minimum viable React wrapper
- citrus + React hooks: events + effects, like Elm. wow!
- playground: editor + results.
- shadow.remote: client/server eval, stores results to inspect

## Next
- either "playground" or "file tree" over shadow.remote

## Later
- Server
  - Edit and save
  - Playground
- Client
  - Edit and save
  - Playground
- Console output
- File/namespace browser
- "Code Bubbles"
- Visual results.
- Visual editor tools.
- Fully consider hot-loading: "other" client windows (like figwheel); ns tracker

## Notes
LightTable-like "inline" bookmarks
- look nice, saves space
- api is a bit difficult to fit into React
- hard to "select" or use the results
"autocomplete" over remote e.g. live JS object for suggestions
